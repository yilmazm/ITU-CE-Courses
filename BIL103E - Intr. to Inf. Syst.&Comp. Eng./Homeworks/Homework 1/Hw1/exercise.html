		This is not yet a great website. It is not even in HTML.
		Please make it great and also in HTML.
		I add this line.

		<p title="It is my first paragraph">
			I want computer engineer because I like to work with computer. When I saw computer first
		time, I was 10 years old and I was very <!-- this will be ignored --> surprised. It is very smart and very talented machine. It do
		that I want everything so I like the computer very much. While time was pass, my interest
		increased.
			
		</p> 

		<p>I entered the university entrance exam. My rating was high. But I did not want to read verbal
		parts or medicine. I was interested in engineering. I thought for a while between mechanical
		engineering and computer engineering. Computer engineering has become more attractive. When I
		started the my departmen, <em>I realized that I made the right decision. When I saw the coding</em> course, I
		realized again that I like the software.</p>
		<p title = "title of paragraph">After graduation, I want to go to the field of software. I want to graduate and doctorate. If
		possible I want to work in company like <b title="havelsan title">HAVELSAN</b>. Because I want to be useful for my country.
		To maintain my academic career is another thought. If possible I would like to work at Istanbul
		Technical University.</p>
