		<p><strong>Necmettin Erbakan</strong> (29 October 1926 – 27 February 2011) is a mechanical engineer graduated from Istanbul Technical University. He has made many technological breakthroughs in our country and has made presidencies in important institutions. He found politics as the method of removing obstacles in the end of his efforts to destroy the external dependency of our country. He was a prime minister for a term of him life. I also briefly talk from him in this site.</p>
