			Matthew Mercer, who leads Critical Role as the dungeon master, lists role-playing games among the greatest inspirations in his life. He once said the following in an interview:
		</p>
		
		<blockquote cite="https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddkenreck/2017/04/25/how-matthew-mercer-critical-role-changed-dungeons-dragons/#36fd6ad06d3a">
			A lot of the ground work for me as a performer really began at my at-home role-playing games.
		</blockquote>
		
		<p>
			The series began on March 13, 2015 with the episode <q>Arrival at Kraghammer</q>, but the group began playing together much earlier in 2012. The series won great acclaim in its first month with its first three episodes, entitled as follows:
